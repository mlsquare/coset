## 🔧 Key Optimizations

### 1. Vectorized Encoding-to-Index Conversion
```cuda
// Before: Sequential loop with 8 iterations
for (int k = d - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
    encoding_idx += encoding_val * power;
    power *= q;
}

// After: Unrolled operations with pre-computed powers
const int powers[8] = {1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187};
// Direct computation without loops
```

### 2. Larger Thread Blocks
```cuda
// Before: 16x16 = 256 threads per block
dim3 threads_per_block(16, 16);

// After: 32x32 = 1024 threads per block  
dim3 threads_per_block(32, 32);
```

### 3. Optimized Memory Access
- Memory coalescing for better GPU utilization
- Reduced memory traffic with fused operations
- Better cache utilization patterns
