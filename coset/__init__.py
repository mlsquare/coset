"""
Coset: Hierarchical Nested-Lattice Quantization for PyTorch

A high-performance PyTorch library implementing Hierarchical Nested-Lattice Quantization (HNLQ)
for quantization-aware training (QAT) and distributed training optimization.

Key Features:
- Multi-lattice support (Z², D₄, E₈)
- Hierarchical encoding/decoding with M levels
- QAT integration
- Distributed training optimization
- Lookup table-based inner products
